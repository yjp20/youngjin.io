Below is a list of ideas for projects and other random thoughts. Feel free to take any of them! But I'd love to
hear if you did.

* A modular iot device (like a packaged raspberry pi zero) which plugs into speakers, lights, and coffee
  machines. Basically an open-source sonos like environment that can be plugged into other home ecosystems?
  Would be nice to have an audio module, a lightbulb module, an rgb light strip module, etc.

* A rss-like protocol for social media, and a client which traverses the graph to find related content.

* An index for civic engagement and government resources.

* ...expanding
