It's already February, and the spirit of the new years has long faded. I think it's about the right time to give this February the 202X special and bust a fat nut of pessimism in it! Without a further ado, let's get started with my 2022 Desolutions.

Things to give up on:
* Art
* League of Legends
* Chess
* Music
* Competitive Programming
* Climbing
* TFT

Growing old, some would say, is not about becoming who you want to be, but giving up on who you can't. Maybe that's just for losers. Either way, I'm sure as fuck a loser and sure as fuck growing older.

Giving up on dreams is okay, if not necessary. I have, optimistically speaking, about 80 years left of my life. Less or more, depending on the amount of league I elect to play. During that time, I want to focus on not becoming some image of "great", but to *create* great things. Here's a pretty limited list of the things I want to create:

* Programming language
* Operating system
* Storybased something
* Game
* An animated fight scene
* Some kind of music
* Some sense of added value to the world

80 years in not that long of a time to do everything I want to do, so I naturally have to give up on some of these as well to make space.

And who knows if my new list of things I want to accomplish will stay the same come next year. Figuring out what I truly care about is never sure, because only time and effort can reveal which dreams hold up. It's a tiring and disheartening thing.

Finally, I will offer another, perhaps less cynical interpretation. If I grow as a person, then it follows that I must also change. My dreams are me manifest, so they are bound to change as well. While it's impossible to tell if this change is for the better or for the worse, at the very least change implies I'm not standing still, and I'll take that.
