It's already February, and the spirit of the new years has long faded. I think it's about the right time to give this February the 202X special and bust a fat nut of pessimism in it! Without a further ado, let's get started with my 2022 Desolutions.

* I will give up on becoming a talented artist. At the very least, I will never, ever be Kim Jung-gi.
* I will stop trying to climb seriously in League of Legends.
* I don't actually care about chess, and I should play puzzles because that's what I enjoy.
* I might learn an instrument, and I really want to some day, but I should never let the creeping expectation of being good at the instrument strike me unaware.
* I will never beat tourist at competitive programming.
* I will never climb Silence.
* I really, really don't need Challenger in TFT.

Growing old, some would say, is not about becoming who you want to be, but giving up on who you can't. Well, I sure as fuck am growing older, aren't I.

Giving up on dreams is okay, if not necessary. I have, optimistically speaking, about 80 years left of my life. During that time, I want to focus on not becoming some delusional image of greatness, but to *create* great things. Here's a pretty limited list of the things I want to create:

* Programming language
* Operating system
* Storybased something
* Game
* An animated fight scene
* Some kind of music
* Some sense of added value to the world

80 years in not that long of a time to do everything I want to do, so I naturally have to give up on somethings to make space.

And who knows if my new list of things I want to accomplish will stay the same come next year. Figuring out what I truly care about isn't easy, because I can only really tell which dreams are worth it by putting them through the one true acid test, that is, trying to achieve them. It's a tiring and disheartening thing.

Finally, I will offer another, perhaps less cynical interpretation of the changing of dreams. If I grow as a person, then it follows that I must also change. My dreams are my desires manifest, so they are bound to change as well.
