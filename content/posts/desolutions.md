It's already February, and the spirit of the new years has long faded. I think it's about the right time to give this February the 202X special and bust a fat nut of pessimism in it! Without a further ado, let's get started with my 2022 Desolutions.

* I will give up on becoming a talented artist. At the very least, I will never, ever be Kim Jung-gi.
* I will stop trying to climb seriously in League of Legends.
* I don't actually care about chess, and I should play puzzles because that's what I enjoy.
* I might learn an instrument, and I really want to some day, but I should never let the creeping expectation of being good at the instrument strike me unaware.
* I will never beat Vaxei at osu!
* I will never beat tourist at competitive programming.
* I will never climb Silence.
* I really don't need Challenger in TFT.

Growing old, some would say, is not about becoming who you want to be, but giving up on who you can't. Well, I sure as fuck am growing older, aren't I.

But it's not all bad, because becoming older is a different thing from becoming more mature. As far as my limited understanding goes, maturity is about life, and life is all about tradeoffs (see my post about [the golden mean](/1_gold_mean.md)).

Giving up on dreams is okay, if not necessary. I have, optimistically speaking, about 80 years left of my life. During that time, I want to focus on not becoming some delusional image of greatness, but to *create* great things. Here's a pretty limited list of the things I want to create:

* Programming language
* Operating system
* Storybased something
* Game
* An animated fight scene
* Some kind of music
* Some sense of added value to the world

80 years in not that long of a time to do everything I want to do, so I naturally have to give up on somethings to make space. Don't worry dreams, you're just going to a nice upstate farm where you can truly hop around and have a jolly time.

Figuring out what I truly care about isn't easy, because you can only really know by putting your dreams through the acid test, that is, trying to achieve them. And every time you don't find gold, it's easy to get disheartened.

Another way to look at it is that if I grow as a person, then I must also change as a person. Then you could say that my dreams have changed and have gotten more concrete, not that I've given up on them, which sure as heck sounds a whole of a lot better. What's important, however, is that the contrapositive implies a dire situation that I will try to avoid at all costs. So I can at least take solace in that.

*P.S. Despite all my joking about pessimism at the beginning (or did that feel to real? I don't even know if I'm joking anymore), this was actually a pretty cathartic exercise. I would recommend it! Talk about everything you've given up on! It sounds counterintuitive, but at least for me and the state of mind I'm in right now, it was extremely uplifting.*
