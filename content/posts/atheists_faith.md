The year is 2012 -- the year I turned 10. With a decade of existence under my belt, I was a moderately precocious, considerably annoying kid who thought he knew the world. Just smart enough that teachers didn't know what to do with me, but not smart enough to know what to do with myself. My fourth grade teacher pawned me off to a middle school teacher to talk about science during recess. Later he would change his name since his old name would come up on google for a drug offense. That was a big no-no in Korea. The girls thought he was a creep. He was a good guy to me though, since he taught me about how fission reactors worked (sorta).

At this time, I was the kind of kid to enthusiastically read encyclopedias. I read volumes of them in the corner of my school's library, where they likely haven't been touched in a decade and most definitely haven't been touched since.

A new medium was coming into fashion as well. Youtube was becoming *big*. Charlie bit everybody's fingers. I ate up all the science and math videos I could find. By the time I went to middle school and was bed-ridden from a botched circumcision, I had diligently watched all the videos in almost every big science channel that I didn't know what to watch anymore. I no longer had my go-to escape, and was left with a throbbing pain that required distraction. The trauma of a bloody wiener loomed large. It was truly tragic. Then I thought of a brilliant idea -- I could just watch them again.

I tried to understand everything, learn about everything. When teachers got a detail wrong, I would not let them go until corrected. To me, learning was sacred, and I believed it was the teacher's duty to their students to educate, to inspire, to be correct.

More and more things started to make sense to me, but I never understood religion. Being raised in a weakly-religious family, everything seemed half-assed and inconsistent. I increasingly felt that there was little evidence of such a thing as providence, at least as characterized by the bible or any other holy text.

Adding to my confusion, I knew that some of the smartest people are devout practicioners. How could such smart people not sense the cognitive dissonance? It had to be something wrong with me. With religion being a touchy subject and me being a curious kid, I could only ask one of my closest friends, and I pestered him to the point of harassment (sorry Kevin). Still, I couldn't really figure out why, except for the fact that most people who are religious just "feel" like it is clearly right. Whilst unsatisfied, I left it at that, at least until many years later.

## Goodhart's law

I forget where or how I learned about Goodhart's law, but I do remember that I mistakenly thought it was called Good Heart's Law, which greatly skewed my interpretation of it. So what is it? Stated in its original context, Goodhart's law is a rather simple observation in economics.

> Any observed statistical regularity will tend to collapse once pressure is placed upon it for control purposes

Or put another way, once a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.

Some thought shows that this is clearly true. Suppose you had a metric that tells you what is a good stock. Once this metric is found, and then acted upon, the prices of stocks in the market would account for the metric and the metric would cease to be useful.

As another example, suppose we consider unemployment rate as a measure of the health of our economy. The government could, perhaps, lower the unemployment rate by giving everyone who wants a job a job. Certainly that would reduce the unemployment rate to zero, but that would hardly be considered healthy for the economy (although maybe not, I'm not an economist).

This law applies outside of economics as well. Students who are aiming to go to the top colleges can optimize solely for high SAT scores and high GPAs. While in a vacuum these might be good metrics of a student's talent and effort, once students start optimizing for these metrics it becomes a terrible indicator, becoming largely a test of socio-economic factors. I would know, as a product on one of those environments.

## An atheist's faith

Okay, that came out of nowhere. Why am I suddenly talking about Goodhart's law? Because I'm a bad writer. But the other reason is that it has to do with the meaning of life. No, seriously.

First, let's talk about the rammifications of Goodhart's law. In the context of measuring a student's aptitude, an interesting observation is that simple and transparent indicators (SATs, tests, etc.) are complete shit. That makes perfect sense though, because a test like the SAT reduces the various qualities of a student into a couple of numbers. When this indicator becomes a target, a whole lot of other things are neglected. The loss in dimensionality is simply staggering -- it's obvious that anything that reduces a student down to a couple of numbers can't possibly be a good target. Not the SAT, not the LSAT, not the GPA, nor whatever numeric indicator you can think of. Yes, the SAT *is bad*, but the SAT simply cannot be good, because the role it's trying to fill is a futile one.

I would go even further to say it applies to how I think about personal goals. Some would say that you should try to be as happy as possible, but that would imply that it would be a good thing to overdose on drugs till you die. At least for me, that's hardly satisfying. Or you could say to have as many friends as possible, get as much money as possible, or whatever else that seems like an indicator of a happy life. But as I'm sure you could relate, optimizing for one single metric hardly results in a happy person. It's obvious that the more factors we account for, the more complexity that we add to the metric, it becomes closer to the real thing, whatever that may be.

We are faced with one simple reality -- the world is complex. We can't create simple metrics for complex things. If that was possible, it would cease to be complex. And we should be thankful for it too, since complexity makes life worth living. Imagine if life's meaning really was just 42.

Really, I'm just stating an obvious thing. Complex things don't have simple answers. When philosophers ask what is the meaning of life, what is the right thing to do, what is consciousness, I feel like the question itself is inherently impossible to answer. The true answer to any of these questions is viciously complex, but I certainly wouldn't want to live in any other universe.

It's now 2022. It took a whole another decade since first pondering these questions for me to realize that the right thing to do is to try to do the right thing. The meaning of life, is to try to live. Consciousness, is to try to think. Complete non-answers, yes, but it does it's job for me.

Finally, I will talk about my faith, an atheist's faith. Perhaps it is the result of privilege, a blessed upbringing, but I have found through experience that such a thing as karma truly exists. Doing the right thing -- no, just trying to do the right thing affects an unbelievable number of factors. Such a thing cannot be measured, or be ever really understood. But I believe these lurking factors will eventually answer back, even screams into the void.

I know I will truly never be able to explain this faith, or justify it to any extent. But I know it exists. I understand now the feeling of faith. I understand how people can believe in religion, and I can't help but wonder if all religions stem from this shared belief in karma.
