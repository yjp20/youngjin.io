Writing is a weird thing. Before I write something, I feel like I have something coherent, something meaningful, and something definite in my mind that I want to get down, to share with the world. The moment I start writing, I realize that it is not the case. Sometimes I feel like I'm convincing myself by writing that the wordsd on the page are in fact my intentions, but it's not.

This all reminds me of a conversation in a philosphy class I took. We were talking about the nature of thought through imagining what a building looks like. When I imagine a building, I feel like I have a coherent idea of what that building is. Most importantly, it is very clear to me that this building I'm thinking of is in fact a building! But when I try to think about the details of this building, the number of floors it has, the number of windows, the precise shape, the entrance, the materials its made of, where the restrooms are, or any possible aspect of an infinitely complex set of choices, it becomes ever more obvious to me that I never really had a coherent idea of what a building is. Strangely, the harder and harder I look, the blurrier the image gets.

It makes me wonder which one is flawed -- my imagination or the medium. Is it necessarily the case that my imagination was lacking? It could also be the case that when I think of a building, I'm thinking of the amorphous collective of all buildings that I've seen. Perhaps what is really happening is that when I'm observing the details of the building, I'm flattening out what is a beautifully complex image, an abstraction of what a building is into a single possiblity.

Similarly, perhaps my thoughts unexpressed have a finer quality to them. The moment I try to express it in words, to linearize it, to reduce it to what is representable on a page, I kill the essence of the idea and leave it as only a single arrangement of thoughts.

In the end I suppose it is hard to make a concrete value judgement. More than anything, writing an idea down encourages approaching the idea from another angle, like water fit into a variety of containers. Writing is just one of these containers, but there are a whole variety in my head. Perhaps that is not such a bad thing after all, but it's also not the most amazing thing as I've thought it was before.
