My favorite game to play as a kid was to guess about how things worked. For example, I would look out the car at whatever caught my eye, such as a bridge, then inevitably make wacky theories about how it was made. As you might imagine, sometimes these guesses would be somehow accurate, but more often than not they were disatrously wrong. Even worse, I had no regard for truth so a conjecture would only need to be mildly convincing for me to accept it as a fact.

While this was a useful exercise for sharpening my thinking process, it also meant that I carried many misconceptions and bad assumptions later into life. I thought the lThe most egregious these beliefs, propelled by my youthful naivety, was that all problems were solvable, that anything was possible.
