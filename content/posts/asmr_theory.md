I've been really into ASMR videos recently, which if you've been living under a rock are videos that contain
sounds that promote the tingly sensation in the back of your head. Usually this inv Not everyone experiences
this and it's still a little unknown (from my brief review of literature). This is my pseudo-scientific
attempt to explain it.

First, if you've never experienced it, I'd say that the feeling is oddly similar to the tingly feeling you get
if you point a sharp object (or even someone else's finger) between your eyes. If you've never experienced
the between-your-eyes tingle, I'd suggest you try it. It's more effective if somebody else is doing it and
even something like a finger will do it. If you don't feel it immediately, try holding it for like 10-20s.

I think there are some interesting parallels between the two sensations that are worth pointing out. The
between-your-eyes tingle is supposed to help you sense danger, and the fact that you feel it drastically more
if you're not in control corroborates that fact. ASMR, I think, is also caused by a similar sensation of
danger -- ASMR often has someone whispering like they're close to you, and obviously the closer they are the
more danger they can potentially pose.

And to me, this checks out. Letting yourself be vulnerable is a relaxing experience, and usually a sign of a
strong relationship. Vulnerability to your friends, family, significant other, coworkers, etc. is perhaps the
strongest evidence of trust. Vulnerablity is not a sign of weakness.

Obviously, there is no real danger in an ASMR video, and you know that, but your body feels the danger.
Perhaps ASMR is a replacement for presence of strong relationships.
