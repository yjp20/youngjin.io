Empathy doesn't scale. It's obvious to me, and it's obvious to you. The amount of fucks one can give is a limited and hopelessly contested resource. Empathy among friends and family is already precious. By the time we get to groups in the tens of thousands, it almost doesn't exist. By the millions? Forget about it.

This is why captialism works so well. It doesn't rely on emapthy among fellow human beings to have a relatively efficient economic system, unlike a system of altruism. Altruism has worked fine in small groups, but it just doesn't work today with billions of people working together in a global econmoic system.

But an economic system devoid of emapthy -- is that really what we want?

Here in Berkeley, I notice that a lot of the most successful companies here are small and even worker-owned cooperatives. Acme bread, Cheeseboard, BSC, etc. It appears to me that it is in fact possible to create small to medium size companies that rely on emapthy for success.

In these cases, emapthy plays a direct role in creating a better product. Each member of a cooperative feels taken care of. The pay structure is generally equal, regardless of experience. Workers succeed together, fail together. There are no executives that earn millions of dollars with employees that earn minimum wage. Emapthy of this sort creates a different kind of strength. Money is one factor, and an important one at that, but its hedged against other, more intangible things.

But beyond profit or loss, these companies seem like places I would want to work. The nature of "work" is very different, and as I imagine, far more fulfilling.

Work has been characterized as a materialistic free-for-all, a simple exchange of labor for capital. So many a times you hear that you have no responsibilities to your employer, to jump ship when the time is right, and that the employer gives no fucks about you. This is presented as matter of fact, is often accurate, but we rarely question whether or not that has to or should be the case. For me at least, I would like another alternative.

I want to participate in transactions that fulfill the spirit of trade -- good for you, good for me. A trade with winners and losers are not trades at all, but exploitation. Even if a system of self-interests manages to create a balance between two parties such as employer and employee, that doesn't sit right with me. I believe I'm always in it to create more value, not to play a zero-sum game. And to take it a bit further, I believe that most people feel the same, at least intuitively. Otherwise, why would it be necessary for people to keep reminding others that loyalty for your employer doesn't matter? Such self-interested behavior is distinctly counter-intuitive and unnatural.

The fact of the matter is this: the current economic system functions, but it's also deeply broken. As a society, we should be productive enough such that we should be able to guarantee that *everybody* has their basic needs met. The fact that this isn't happening suggests exploitation of the highest kind. For me, this isn't necessarily about unequal opportunities, privilege, or discrimination -- it's the result of a system that lacks the most basic emapthy.

The many steps of abstraction, a practically infinitely complicated mesh of transactions hides the fact that this exploitation is going on, but it is. And such abstraction encourages the diffusion of blame, and we end up as an entire society held unaccountable.

If you really think about it, capitalism is not so different from slavery. In slavery, slave owners owns the source of labor, or slaves. In capitalism, slaver owners own capital, which accrues more capital, which can be converted to labor. Ultimately, individuals can command "free" labor. That is an irrefutable result.

Don't get me wrong, I am not drawing a moral equivalency between slave owners and capitalists. Or maybe I am, because I don't really blame slave owners. Just like how we are a part of a system that is hard to refute, slave owners were too. And anyways, they're long dead. Their statute of limitations have long passed, and at the very least it is not my position or my desire to pass a verdict on their lives.

## An idealist's vision of the future

So ultimately, what do I want? Nothing crazy, and definitely nothing new. Capitalism is most likely not going to go away, as there simply is value in the means of production, in the timing of things, and just a whole lot of factors outside of labor that are hard to capture in another system. Ultimately, though, I hope we can all behave in ways that are more empathetic to each other and less strictly self-interested. More specifically, we need to change the way that we frame "the game" and success. A change in values in necessary.

I'm sure you're thinking, no shit Young-Jin, who doesn't know that. I know, I know. I have some more actionable ideas soon...

First, I naively suggest that we foster empathy by building systems which have proven to work -- smaller systems. Even better, cooperatives. Capitalism needs to exist, because empathy doesn't scale. But in smaller groups, we can create systems designed for people.

Second, be cognizant of your exploitation. Be wary of free wins. Creating win-win situations require a lot of work, and there is simply no shortcut to these value producing endeavors. Easy, free wins, if such things exist, likely means you have exploited others. Suppose you "earn" 6 million dollars through cryptos. Frankly, you haven't done shit for society. On the other hand, you have gained capital that by itself is conservatively capable of generating 100,000$ a year, which is more than the median household income. Again, there is a system of abstraction at play, but that amount of money is equivalent to owning the labor of a slave. Even worse, because you have taken 6 million dollars and have generated little to nothing for society, you have effectively taken 6 million dollars away from the "system", but really just from people. To me, this is rather morally dubious.

Third, work on small scales. I know for a fact I won't change the world. The world is just too big. But we are given choices, both small and big. I don't know if I would be faithful to my values every time, but I'm going to try. Dave Chappelle walked away from 50 million dollars. Top Dog didn't kill Ducky.

Now, I haven't worked much in my life. For the little I did, it's hard to say that it is representative of society. I also have been subject to an abundance of privilege, and a fair amount of attempts to "game the system". That's to say, take what I'm about to say with a grain of salt. I'm well aware it might be overly naive, but I can't help but observe what I observe and feel what I feel.
