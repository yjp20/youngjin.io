I rememeber reading about Aristotle's "golden mean" as a kid and being rather insulted. Here was a supposedly great polygot whose ideas were dominant in the western sphere for a millenia, telling me how it's usually better to be in the middle than be in the extremes.

Like seriously, who doesn't know this?

At the time I was in elementary school, and it was still painfully obvious to me back then. How could it not be, what with books and movies rehashing this idea a thousand times over. Goldilocks, one of the most told stories of all time, is all about this!

But like much of life's wisdoms, it's not the principles but the examples that truly matter. It wasn't until I revisited the idea many years later
